"""

Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
Arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
smallest positive missing number is 1.
