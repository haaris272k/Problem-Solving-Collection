"""Chef has two distinct positive integers A and B.

Chef wonders how many distinct values are possible for the expression gcd(A+X,B+X), where X can take any non-negative integer value.

Help Chef find this value.

Here, gcd stands for Greatest Common Divisor.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer T â€” the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two distinct space separated integers A and B.

Input
2
